### Convert bednet usage to nets-per-capita (NPC)

# Goal: produce country-specific loess functions to predict npc for a given (continuous) 
# input usage or access. Define a simple rule to extrapolate curves beyond 
# observed levels of usage access.

# For each country, what steady-state nets-per-capita is required to attain a given net use?
# Assumptions: 
# - Net use rates stays at 2019 levels for all countries
# - When converting from access to NPC, use the 2019 loess curve fit of access-NPC 
#   at the country-month level.
# - When determining the number of nets to distribute in each mass campaign, 
#   assume mass campaigns occur every three years.

### Original approach ----

# Input usage, convert this to access, then use Loess curve to generate corresponding NPC
target_uses <- seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1)

targets_all <- lapply(target_uses, function(this_use){
  targets_dt <- cube_nat_level_annual[, list(iso3, year, access, use, use_rate, 
                                             percapita_nets, target_use=this_use)]
# Convert target usage to target access: access = usage/use rate
# since use rate = the proportion of people with access to a net who slept under it
  targets_dt[, target_access:= target_use/use_rate] # TODO: what if target_access > 1?
  targets_dt <- targets_dt[order(target_access)]
  targets_dt[target_access<=max(loess_for_prediction$loess), 
             target_percapita_nets:= interp1(loess_for_prediction$loess, 
                                             loess_for_prediction$percapita_nets, 
                                             target_access)] 
  # Relationship between access and NPC is aggregated for all countries,
  # but use rate to convert usage to access is country-specific (derived from spatiotemporal regression?)
  return(targets_dt[order(iso3)])
})

targets_all <- rbindlist(targets_all)
targets_all[, target_use:=factor(target_use)]

### Option 1: increase use rate to 1 to reach the desired usage

# One option I considered was to, in these cases, set the use rate to increase to 1 or 
# the highest observed level anywhere (0.96) to reach the desired usage. 
# That would keep all target access values close to, but below, 1. It means
# however that in a few countries, the target access and hence nets per capita 
# will not increase with increasing coverage (e.g., nets per capita for target 
# usage of 80% would be less than those for 70%), so that doesnâ€™t really make sense.

target_uses <- seq(0.5, 0.9, 0.1)

# Firstly, change dataset so as to extrapolate linearly between last access point and 1
# on the access-NPC curve
loess_for_prediction <- subset(loess_for_prediction, 
                               !(percapita_nets %in% npc_to_extrapolate))
loess_for_prediction <- rbind(loess_for_prediction,
                              data.frame(iso3=NA, month=NA, access=1,

  targets_dt <- cube_nat_level_annual[, list(iso3, year, access, use, use_rate, 
                                             percapita_nets, target_use=this_use)]
  # Convert target usage to target access: access = usage/use rate
  # since use rate = the proportion of people with access to a net who slept under it

})

targets_all <- rbindlist(targets_all)

ggplot(targets_all) +
  geom_line(aes(x=target_use, y = target_access, group = iso3))

### Option 2: limit  access to 1 where it exceeds it (or increase use rate to target usage where it is lower) ----

# Another simple option would be to increase the use rate to the target usage 
# (where it is below this value), giving a target access of 1. This means that 
# increasing target usage will lead to increasing or constant target access. 
# However, it also means that in some countries, a target access of 1 is already 
# reached with a 70% target usage. That would imply that reaching a target usage 
# of 70%, 80%, 90% etc. in these countries would all require the same nets per capita 
# and hence presumably the same cost. The assumption behind this being that any 
# further increases in usage are not achieved through distribution of more bednets, 
# but through making it more efficient (at no extra cost). 

targets_all <- lapply(target_uses, function(this_use){
  targets_dt <- cube_nat_level_annual[, list(iso3, year, access, use, use_rate, 
                                             percapita_nets, target_use=this_use)]
  # Convert target usage to target access: access = usage/use rate
  # since use rate = the proportion of people with access to a net who slept under it
