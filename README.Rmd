Netz is here to help setup bed nets in [malariasimulation](https://mrc-ide.github.io/malariasimulation/).

Much of the functionality within this package is based on the excellent bed net model by [Bertozzi-Villa, Amelia, et al. Nature communications 12.1 (2021): 1-12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23707-7), please check it out
and make sure to cite appropriately if you use this package.
